You're in a tough but very achievable position! It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and anxious, especially when navigating a significant career change in a new country.  Let's break down how to unblock yourself and take those crucial steps, focusing on **baby steps** tailored to your situation.

**Understanding Your Situation & Feelings:**

* **Valid Anxiety:**  Acknowledge that your anxiety is valid. You're facing a big change, language hurdles, and the sting of past experiences. Don't dismiss these feelings; understand them.
* **Intermediate Japanese is Good:**  Recognize that your intermediate Japanese is a valuable asset. While business Japanese is different, you have a foundation.

1. **Micro-Research Focus (15 minutes):**
   * **Goal:** Pick just *one* company from your list that you're mildly interested in – not your absolute dream company yet.

   * **Goal:** Draft *one* short message to a potential connection on LinkedIn who works at a company you're interested in (can be the same one or a different one).
   * **Action:** Keep it brief and genuine. Example: "こんにちは [Name], I'm a career changer from English teaching currently learning full-stack development. I'm impressed by [Company Name]'s work in [mention something specific]. Would you be open to a brief chat about your experience there?"  *Don't send it yet.*

4. **Business Japanese "Byte" (10 minutes):**
   * **Goal:** Learn *one* new business Japanese phrase related to job searching or interviews.
   * **Action:**  Look up phrases like: "お忙しいところ恐縮ですが (Oisogashii tokoro kyōshuku desu ga - I apologize for bothering you while you're busy)," or "お話をお伺いできますでしょうか (Ohanashi o ukagai dekimasu deshou ka - Would it be possible to hear about your experience?)."  Write it down.

**Phase 2:  Building Momentum (Next Week)**

1. **Informational Interview Outreach (5 minutes):**

   * **Goal:** Write the opening paragraph of a cover letter for the *one* company you researched.
   * **Action:** Focus on why you're interested in *that specific company* and what excites you about their work. Keep it concise and enthusiastic.

3. **Past Interview Reflection (15 minutes):**
   * **Goal:**  Pick *one* bad interview experience.
   * **Action:**  Write down *one* specific thing you learned from that experience.  Focus on the learning, not the negative feelings. Example: "I learned I need to practice explaining my coding projects more clearly."

4. **Practice Japanese Clarification (10 minutes):**
   * **Goal:** Practice saying *one* phrase for asking for clarification in Japanese.
   * **Action:**  Practice saying "すみません、もう一度お願いできますか？(Sumimasen, mō ichido onegai dekimasu ka? - Excuse me, could you say that one more time?)" out loud a few times.

**Phase 3: Taking Small Application Steps (Week After)**

1. **Apply to the "Practice" Company (10 minutes):**
   * **Goal:**  Submit the application to the *one* company you've been focusing on.
   * **Action:**  Just click the "apply" button and submit the materials you've prepared (resume, opening paragraph of the cover letter).  Think of this as a low-stakes practice run.

2. **Review and Learn from Application (20 minutes):**
   * **Goal:** After applying, review the application process.
   * **Action:** What was easy? What was difficult?  Did you feel prepared?  Jot down your observations.

3. **Identify Your Fear (15 minutes):**
   * **Goal:**  Pinpoint your biggest fear about interviewing.
   * **Action:** Write down exactly what you're most afraid of.  Be specific.  Example: "I'm afraid I won't be able to answer the technical questions in Japanese."

4. **Find a Mock Interview Partner (15 minutes):**
   * **Goal:** Reach out to a classmate or someone in your network to ask if they'd be willing to do a short mock interview with you.
   * **Action:**  Keep the request casual. "Hey [Name], would you be willing to practice some interview questions with me sometime this week?  I'm feeling a bit nervous about the process."

**Addressing Your Anxiety and Mental Block:**

* **Celebrate Small Wins:** Acknowledge and celebrate each small step you take.  You researched a company! You updated your resume! That's progress.
* **Focus on the Process, Not the Outcome:**  Right now, your goal isn't to get a job offer, it's to take action and learn.
* **Reframe Rejection:**  See rejections as feedback and learning opportunities. Each "no" gets you closer to a "yes."
* **Practice Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself during this challenging time.  It's okay to feel anxious.

    *   The worst possible outcome.
    *   The likelihood of it happening (be honest).
    *   How you could realistically handle it if it did.
*   **Baby Step 3 (Day 3):** List 5 things you've already accomplished in this journey (e.g., enrolled in the course, learned a new programming concept, improved your Japanese, etc.).
*   **Baby Step 4 (Day 4):** Find one positive affirmation related to your career change (e.g., "I am learning valuable skills every day," "I am capable of succeeding in this new field"). Repeat it to yourself several times throughout the day.
*   **Baby Step 5 (Day 5):** Reflect on one past bad interview. What is one specific thing you learned from it that you can apply to future interviews?

*   **Baby Step 13:**  Look at your resume. Is there one small section you can update or improve today? Spend 20 minutes on it.
*   **Baby Step 14:** Identify one person in your network (friend, family, classmate) who you can talk to about your career change. Send them a message just saying you'd like to chat sometime.
